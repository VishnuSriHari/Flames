# Flames
A C program for the high school love compatiblity game.
This program gets two names as arrays, removes spaces in them, 
changes any upper case letter to lower case, removes same elements and calculate flames according to remaining letters.
In Flames, the number of unsimilar characters of both the names is calculated and each letter of flames is counted to that number and the letter
at final number is removed. This process is done until one of the letter in flames remains and it is considered as their relationship.
